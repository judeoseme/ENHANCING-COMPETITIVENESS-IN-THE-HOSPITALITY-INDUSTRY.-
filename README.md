Enhancing Competitiveness in the Hospitality Industry. A case study of Management Strategy
Hotel companies operate in a highly competitive environment, targeting much client from the international market with many specialties. The management in these too demanding conditions is called upon to apply modern strategic management practices by analyzing global developments and supporting the decision-
making process by limiting the uncertainty created by the external environment Competitiveness has been a subject of study in almost all sectors of the economy. Although the idea was first proposed by an economist called porter (1990). It is an important factor necessary for growth and development in business and organization as they continue to strive to maintain a competitive edge. Through the years, tourism has been one of the important sectors of the economy with a continuous increase in growth rate and one of the most internationalized which has also attracted several hotels around the world. This competitiveness has really eaten deep virtually every facet of the economy. In this study I shall be discussing competitiveness in the hospitality industry that require a critical review. As a result of this growth, the world market at large experiences a growing competition between tourist countries. (Kovacic 2004). The hotel industry is one of the main components of tourism. It is a promising sector that has added growth and development to so many countries. For hotel to be effectively managed, it requires management strategy that can stand the test of time. For example, Dubai. Dubai boosts one of the best hotels in the World. As such many people travel to Dubai for tourism. Thereby generating revenue for the country. A hotel’s ability to be dynamic depends on a few factors such as having an organizational memory that allows for creation circulation and growth of knowledge. This requires a system in which knowledge is constantly being created and shared within the organization, enabling the hotel to respond quickly to changing circumstances. (Fraj et al., 2015). Generally, hotel companies operate in a highly competitive environment. With many businesses vying for the attention and business of travellers. To stand out in this crowded field, and attract customers, hotels must find way to enhance their competitiveness Therefore, it is necessary to apply modern strategic management to enhance the industry. According to Abu Bakar et al. (2011), strategic management is a concept that concerns making decisions and taking corrective actions to achieve long term targets and goals of an organization. In as much as so many hotels are highly competitive, there are still some number of them that has not really lived up to the expectation of the management. As a result of this, this study will tend to look at what could be responsible for the low review of hotels. 

DATASET:
The Dataset that was used for this study was given by the Module Leader Prof. Mo Saree. It was uploaded on the university blackboard where I was able to download it. The dataset contains 5 features which are
1. Hotel ID
2. Review Date
3. Location
4. Hotel / Restaurant name
5. Review. 

A brief description of the algorithms used:
The algorithm that was used in this study is the Natural Language Toolkit. It is suite of text processing libraries for many texts mining and natural language processing (NLP) tasks in python. It provides a set of tools for training and evaluating machine learning models. The natural language toolkit includes a large collection of text data as well as utilities for working with these data such as classification, tokenization and stemming, tagging, parsing, and sentimental analysis. It is a comprehensive result for working with human language data in python. 

The application of data-mining techniques to selected datasets that you choose using Python:
The application of data-mining technique to perform sentimental analysis involves various steps using the natural language toolkit. They include the following.
1. pre-processing of dataset: Obtain a dataset of text document that have been labelled with their sentiments like positive, negative, or neutral. After that you can now proceed to pre-process the data with tokenization or stemming.
2. Features extraction: To use machine learning algorithm, to perform sentimental analysis, it is necessary to extract features from the text data. To do this, you need to represent the text data as numerical features. 
3. Training and Evaluation of a machine learning model: The next application you will need to perform is to split the dataset into training sets and test sets. After that you can use the training set to train a machine learning model for sentimental analysis. This can be done using natural learning toolkit to evaluate various types of models.
4.  Use the train model to classify new text: once you have trained and evaluated a machine learning model for sentimental analysis, it can be used to classify new text data. The natural learning toolkit can be used to predict the sentiment of new text documents. 

Explanation of the experimental procedure, including the setting and optimisation of model hyperparameters during training, and approach to validation:

The experimental procedure for training a natural language learning toolkit model for sentimental analysis involves the following steps. 
1.	Pre-process the data: Before training a natural language processing, the first step to consider is to collect a large dataset of natural language text. This is done to ensure that the data is clean and can be used for training the model. The pre-processing steps include stemming, tokenization, and lemmatization. 
2.	Setting up the model: It is necessary to design the model architecture which determine the performance of a natural language processor. This involves deciding on the number of layers (size of the model) and the model type (transformer).
3.	Setting up the hyperparameters: Another factor that determines the natural language processor is the hyperparameters. Optimization of hyperparameters can be done through a process called hyperparameter tuning. 
4.	Training of the model: After setting the hyperparameters the model can be trained on the dataset. Here, the model’s weight and errors encountered must be updated.
5.	Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model is another step to follow after training the model. The performance must be evaluated on the validation set. This is done to ensure that training data is not overfitted. 
6.	Fine-tune the model: After evaluating the model and discovered that the validation set is not good enough, you can fine-tune the model by adjusting the model architecture and hyperparameters. 
7.	Model Testing: The model performance can now be tested on a separate dataset to have the result of the final estimation.  
Visualisation of the results
There are several ways to the visualize the result of a sentimental analysis model. In this study I used the word cloud. Word clouds are used to visualize and to show the most common words in a dataset. It can be used to understand the most common words related with both positive and negative sentiment in a dataset. The size of the word always indicates its frequency. The word cloud can be generated using the word cloud library. The first thing to do is to create a list of all the word that appears in all negative reviews. 

Results Analysis and Discussion:
Basically, sentimental analysis using the natural language toolkit is an important tool that provides valuable insights into customer satisfaction either positive or negative review as well as the brand perception. In this study, 30 different hotels were selected based on the least review. I carried out the sentimental analysis and used a wordcloud which was generated from the wordcloud library.  Some of the word counter for the negative reviews includes the following 
Food with negative review of 965
Restaurant with negative review of 708
Service with negative review of 330
Place with negative review of 429
Go with negative review of 327
Pizza with negative review of 212
Comparing this with the positive review, 
Food with positive review of 786
Restaurant with positive review of 413
Service with positive review of 323
Place with positive review of 281
Go with positive review of 199
Pizza with positive review of 220.

Conclusion
In this study, 30 hotels were selected based on the least review. From our findings, the 30 hotels have got a very high negative review in their food, services, place etc  as compared to the positive reviews. It is therefore necessary for the management of the hotel to up their game by adopting the management strategy. This will help to promote their business by getting a very high positive review.
